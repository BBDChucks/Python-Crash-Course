## Part 1: Basics
### Chapter 1: Getting Started  
__Python interactive shell__  
To start an interactive REPL session with python, enter the command `python` in you terminal window.
```
$ python

>>> quit()
```

__Python interpreter__

### Chapter 2: Variables and Simple Data Types

$ python

```

### Chapter 3: Introducing Lists

### Chapter 4: Working with Lists
__Tuples__    
Python refers to values that cannot change as immutable, and an _immutable_ list is called a _tuple_.  
Tuples are like list, but you define them using parentheses instead of square brackets.
```
dimension=(200,50)
```
If you want to define a tuple with one element, you need to include a trailing comma:
```
my_tuple = (3,)
```

__Styling your code__  
When someone wants to make a change to the Python language, they write
a _Python Enhancement Proposal_ (PEP). One of the oldest PEPs is PEP 8, which instructs Python programmers on how to style their code.  
See [PEP-8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) to learn more.  

### Chapter 5: If Statements  

### Chapter 6: Dictionaries
